        "A detailed study of the electron-phonon interaction expresses the effective electron-electron inter- action, mediated by one-phonon exchange. This expression is remarkable for two reasons. First, this effective interaction becomes negative (that is, attractive) when- ever the energy difference between the two electrons is less than the energy of the exchanged phonon. Secondly, if this energy difference is close to (but less than) the phonon energy, this attractive interaction becomes large and supersedes the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons.  \n",

        "Remember, the phonon frequency is always less than the Debye frequency $\\omega_D$.  It follows that when the electrons’ energy difference $\\Delta\\epsilon$ is larger than the Debye energy, $\\Delta\\epsilon >\\hbar\\omega_D$, the interaction (3.62) will never be attractive.  Conversely, for $\\Delta\\epsilon <\\hbar\\omega_D$, this will always be attractive for some range of the exchanged phonon energy. The former situation is the one that is most fre- quently found in material systems: the electronic effective interaction is repulsive. This situation is clearly enhanced as we increase the temperature, thereby boosting the electrons’ energy differences. Nevertheless, when we lower the temperature in a metal, we reach a situation in which most of the electrons occupy the states below the Fermi surface. Then, a large number of electrons will be close to the Fermi sur- face, and therefore would have small energy differences. Hence, it is likely that a large number of electrons will be found inside a shell of width of the order of $\\omega_D$ around the Fermi surface ($\\omega_D \\ll \\epsilon_F$). For these electrons, the attractive interaction mediated by phonons (3.62) will be more important than the Coulomb repulsion, and two-electron bound states with opposite spins, called Cooper pairs, will consequently form. These Cooper pairs then form a condensate in which the order parameter has a constant modulus, namely, an incompressible fluid. As we saw above, this is the key condition for the existence of a persistent current. The Cooper pairs therefore are the carriers of the superconducting current.\n",

        "Although Cooper pairing is a quantum effect, the reason for the pairing can be seen from a simplified classical explanation.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair#cite_note-Hyperphysics-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair#cite_note-3) An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative charge, but it also attracts the positive ions that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to electron–phonon interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.\n",
